# ArcadeStore - Workshop-1

This is a project to allow users to purchase an Arcade machine.

The program consists of 3 classes: Games, Machine, and Customers; as well as an 'IEnumeration' class that contains various enumerations used as attributes for the Game and Machine classes.
These three classes enable the operation and storage of the necessary information for the program to function.
The program does not use user interfaces; it is solely used in the command line.
The program offers users options to choose the type of Arcade machine they prefer and ends by printing a receipt.
